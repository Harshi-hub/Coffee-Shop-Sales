# Coffee-Shop-Sales
This project focuses on analyzing coffee sales data using Microsoft Excel to uncover business insights and support data-driven decision making. The raw sales data was cleaned, structured, and analyzed using Excel formulas, Pivot Tables, and Pivot Charts, and then visualized through an interactive dashboard.  The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, revenue trends, product-wise performance, region-wise sales, and monthly growth analysis. Slicers and filters were implemented to allow users to dynamically explore sales performance by coffee type, time period, location, and customer segment.  The project helps identify:  Best-selling coffee products  High-performing regions and stores  Seasonal sales trends  Revenue contribution by category
